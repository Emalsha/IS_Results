## University students results.

This is my first nodeJS project. I used nodejs + AngularJS for develop that web site.

Simple User Interface will help you to understand web site. Only you have do is enter your examinatin index number. You will get whole result. 

## If you like to use this
You should have install nodeJS in your computer.

    1st : Download this project and located in your local machine.
    2nd : run www.js file locatied in bin folder.

          node www.js

    3rd : Go to your wen browser use this url
          http://localhost:3000
          
But you unable to use this because changed the json database file.
I give you two dummy database file.( stored in db file).
Please rename these file as follow:

      sample db 1.json -----> 1st sem results.json
      sample db 2.json -----> 2nd sem results.json
      sample db 3.json -----> second sem.json (In version 2.0) 

Now your app is ready to use.. 

I manualy created these json file using excel sheet. First i calculated results in Excel sheet and then it converted to json.
